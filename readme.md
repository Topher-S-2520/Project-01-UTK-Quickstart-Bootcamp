## This website was built in homage to my family's restaurant that I grew up working in. This is the type of website that might have helped us stay in business longer. It was a bit of a passion project for myself and something that I thoroughly enjoyed doing. 

## There is a navigation bar at the top of the page that allows the user to navigate between the home page, the menu page, and the about us page. On the home page there is a form box where users can (in theory) tell us their memories, or just leave a message for us to view. It also requires the user to leave contact information so that we could possibly reach back out to message sender.
