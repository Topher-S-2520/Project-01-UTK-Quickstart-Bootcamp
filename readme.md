## This website was built in homage to my family's restaurant that I grew up working in. This is the type of website that might have helped us stay in business longer. It was a bit of a passion project for myself and something that I thoroughly enjoyed doing. 

## There is a navigation bar at the top of the page that allows the user to navigate between the home page, the menu page, and the about us page. On the home page there is a form box where users can (in theory) tell us their memories, or just leave a message for us to view. It also requires the user to leave contact information so that we could possibly reach back out to message sender.

## There are 3 .html files and 1 .css file included in this project. Many Bootstrap elements are used throughout.

## Ideas for future improvement:
    -I would like to find more better quality images to add to the project. Many of the images were uploaded using a scanner leading to poor quality
    -I would also like to improve the general aesthetics of the website to make it more fit the actual styling that was in the restaurant itself.
    -I would also like to make it more interactive in that if people do leave us a message or memory, it can be integrated into the website for more than just myself to see.
