            <p>Mom's Italian Villa was founded in 1962 by Ollie "Mom" Parker. Originally called Parker's Home Cooking, it was 
              a Meat and 3 style of restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In the early 70's, she decided to change the direction of the business 
              and rebranded as Mom's Italian Villa. While still serving a traditional southern breakfast, the lunch and dinner menu was completely overhauled to
              feature mainly Italian dishes, centering around our signature sandwich, the Muffaletta. Breakfast service was discontinued in the early 90's, but our 
              lunch and dinner services continued until the restaurant was closed in late 2015.</p>

                <p>Ollie "Mom" Parker was the founder of Mom's Italian Villa. Mom was already a successful business owner when she opened the restaurant in 1962, 
                  owning a local hosiery mill. She was known for her dedication to quality and service. She was a fixture in the restaurant, working 6 days a week, 
                  only taking off on Sundays. She would continue working this schedule well into her 80's, up until her Alzheimer's prevented her from being able to 
                  do the job she loved dearly. Sadly, Mom passed away in 2008, never getting to see the restaurant during its most profitable times.</p>

                <p>Randy Shuford is Mom's grandson, and started working for the restaurant in the early 70's as a teenager. He would work part-time until leaving college. 
                  After college, he began working full-time, learning the ins and outs of the way that Mom ran the business. When Mom's health began to decline, Randy took 
                  over running the day to day operations. He would continue to run the business successfully, working the same hours that his grandmother did, up until 
                  deciding that it was time for a change after 42 years of dedication to the business. Late in 2015, he sold the building the restaurant was located in, but 
                  retained the business rights, leaving the door open to potentially restarting the business, if the opportunity and desire presented themselves in the future.</p>
